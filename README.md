# Colorize SchoolCal

Google Calendar Add-on to set the block color of events synced by SchoolCal

This Google Calendar Add-on searches your calendar for all events synced by SchoolCal from your myGroton Schedule. You can either opt to use pre-defined block colors to assign a color matching the block to your classes, or you can do your own custom search/color-assignment combination. (For example, search for "Advanced History" and color it "Pale Red".) The color palette is limited by the available event colors in Google Calendar.

## Install

[Refer to my gist on Google Workspace Add-on publication](https://gist.github.com/battis/6e32031196316acd1b5e5700b328aef6#file-readme-md) for general directions on how to administratively publish a Google Workspace Add-on.

This add-on is a `Google Workspace Add-on` in its GCP app configuration and uses the Google Calendar API (which should be automatically enabled when you configure the GCP project's OAuth scopes).
